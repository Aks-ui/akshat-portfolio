     I specialise in turning vague, messy business problems into structured,
decision-ready solutions. My background blends product thinking, brand strategy
and operational systems like Epicor — meaning I understand both the commercial
story and the underlying mechanics.

    </p>
    <p class="hero-highlight">
      Recent work includes: Sanofi (Lizipaina), Greggs, FMCG strategy, Epicor WIP flows,
UAT and pre-sales support.

    <div class="card">
      <h3>How I think</h3>
      <p>
        I’m most comfortable when the brief is <em>unclear</em>. I like to take a messy
        situation, strip it down to first principles and rebuild it into a clear problem
        statement, options and trade-offs. I care about structured thinking more than
        flashy frameworks.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>How I work</h3>
      <p>
        I move between analysis, conversation and documentation quickly: talk to people,
        pull the data that matters, sketch the flows, then turn it into a concise story
        that decision-makers can act on. I don’t hide behind jargon and I don’t produce
        slides that go nowhere.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Where I’m useful</h3>
      <p>
        Consulting-style roles where there’s real ambiguity: product strategy, PMO,
        pre-sales or internal projects that need someone to make sense of disconnected
        inputs, align stakeholders and push things over the line.

        <li>
          Mapped the full flow from <em>sales order → MRP → job → WIP → shipment → invoice</em>
          so the team could see, on one page, how operational steps hit financials.
        </li>
        <li>
          Helped diagnose issues like missing labour costs and confusing WIP behaviour by
          tracing data through Epicor, identifying where configuration or process broke.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turned scattered tribal knowledge into clear notes and diagrams used by juniors
          to ramp up faster and make fewer basic mistakes.

        <li>
          Logged and prioritised bugs in JIRA by business impact (P0–P3), including clear
          reproduction steps, recordings and environment details to cut back-and-forth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Acted as a translator between non-technical expectations and engineering reality,

         ’s losing ground.
        </li>
        <li>
          Analysed Greggs’ positioning and customer journeys to understand where the brand
          over-delivers, where it is invisible and what that means for growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built decks that moved from <em>problem → insight → options → recommendation</em>,
