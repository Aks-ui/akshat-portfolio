     I specialise in turning vague, messy business problems into structured,
decision-ready solutions. My background blends product thinking, brand strategy
and operational systems like Epicor — meaning I understand both the commercial
story and the underlying mechanics.

    </p>
    <p class="hero-highlight">
      Recent work includes: Sanofi (Lizipaina), Greggs, FMCG strategy, Epicor WIP flows,
UAT and pre-sales support.

      <h3>How I think</h3>
      <p>
        I’m most comfortable when the brief is <em>unclear</em>. I like to take a messy
        situation, strip it down to first principles and rebuild it into a clear problem
        statement, options and trade-offs. I care about structured thinking more than
        flashy frameworks.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>How I work</h3>
      <p>
        I move between analysis, conversation and documentation quickly: talk to people,
        pull the data that matters, sketch the flows, then turn it into a concise story
        that decision-makers can act on. I don’t hide behind jargon and I don’t produce
        slides that go nowhere.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Where I’m useful</h3>
      <p>
        Consulting-style roles where there’s real ambiguity: product strategy, PMO,
        pre-sales or internal projects that need someone to make sense of disconnected
        inputs, align stakeholders and push things over the line.

          Mapped the full flow from <em>sales order → MRP → job → WIP → shipment → invoice</em>

        </li>

          Helped diagnose issues like missing labour costs and confusing WIP behaviour by
          tracing data through Epicor, identifying where configuration or process broke.

        <li>
          Turned scattered tribal knowledge into clear notes and diagrams used by juniors

        <li>
          Logged and prioritised bugs in JIRA by business impact (P0–P3), including clear

      <h3>Sanofi – Lizipaina Brand Audit</h3>
      <p class="card-tag">Brand Strategy · FMCG</p>
      <p><strong>The situation:</strong> Legacy throat-care brand in a crowded shelf, with
      unclear differentiation and inconsistent in-store execution.</p>
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Structured a full-funnel audit across competition,
      consumer perceptions, retail presence and messaging, using a simple but rigorous
      framework.</p>
      <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Clear strategic routes (defend, stretch, reposition) with
      concrete implications for pack, messaging and activation, rather than a generic “brand health” report.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Greggs – Brand & Customer Journey</h3>
      <p class="card-tag">Retail · Positioning</p>
      <p><strong>The situation:</strong> A loved high-street brand with strong habits but
      fragmented understanding of how customers actually experience it across touchpoints.</p>
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Mapped journeys across in-store, app and everyday
      behaviours, then linked those to perceptions of value, convenience and comfort.</p>
      <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Identified where the brand wins by default and where it
      is effectively invisible, giving a clearer view of where to invest for long-term brand
      equity versus short-term promotions.</p>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>Epicor – Making the System Understandable</h3>
      <p class="card-tag">ERP · Systems Thinking</p>
      <p><strong>The situation:</strong> People were using Epicor every day, but very few
      could explain how actions in the system flowed through to WIP, inventory and margin.</p>
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Documented the end-to-end flow from sales order to
      invoice, highlighting where materials, labour and costs actually move.</p>
      <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> A simple set of flows and notes used by juniors and
      non-finance stakeholders to understand the impact of their choices in the system.</p>
